            <p>Floorball originated in Sweden in the late 1960s and has since grown into a globally recognized sport.</p>
            <p>In Floorball, five field players and a goalkeeper from one team are on the field at the same time. A team usually consists of 15-20 players. The size of the field is 40 x 20 metres, surrounded by a 50 cm high rink. The playing surface is usually made of plastic mat.</p>
            <p>Field players use rackets of about half a body length, approved by the International Floorball Federation and made of glass or carbon fibre. The curvature of the blade shall not exceed 30 mm. The goalkeeper shall not carry a stick. The ball is plastic, weighs 23 grams and has a diameter of 72 millimetres. The ball has 26 holes. The ball is played on goals measuring 115 x 160 cm. The match will be supervised by two referees.</p>
            <p>Tackling is prohibited in floorball, but shoulder to shoulder contact is permitted. The stick may not be used for any purpose other than playing the ball. Fouls are punishable by either a free hit or a penalty, which can be 2, 2+2 or 10 minutes, depending on the nature of the offence. A penalty shot is also possible.</p>
            <p>Substitutions may be made either on the fly or during a stoppage in play like in ice hockey. There is no offside rule in floorball. The duration of a match is 3×20 minutes with time stopping whenever there is a stoppage in play. In the junior matches, the playing time is 3×15 minutes or 2×15 minutes (see the rules of the game for details).</p>
