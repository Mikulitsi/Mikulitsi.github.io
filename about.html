            <h2>What is Floorball?</h2>
            <p>Floorball is a fast-paced indoor team sport that blends speed, skill, and strategy. It originated in Sweden in the late 1960s and is now played in over 70 countries.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The game features five field players and a goalkeeper per team on a 40 x 20 meter court, surrounded by a 50 cm high rink made of plastic mats. Players use sticks (half their body length) made of glass or carbon fiber, with blades curved up to 30 mm. The ball weighs 23 grams, has a 72 mm diameter with 26 holes, and is played into 115 x 160 cm goals. Two referees manage the game.</p>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>The match lasts 3 x 20-minute periods (or 3 x 15/2 x 15 for juniors), with time stopping during breaks. Key rules include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No tackling, but shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed.</li>
                <li>Sticks are for playing the ball only; misuse results in fouls.</li>
                <li>Fouls lead to free hits or penalties (2, 2+2, or 10 minutes) or penalty shots.</li>
                <li>Substitutions can happen on the fly or during stoppages, like ice hockey.</li>
                <li>No offside rule applies.</li>
            </ul>
